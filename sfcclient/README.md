# OpenStack-SFC Client Module #

A client lib for OpenStack [networking-sfc](https://docs.openstack.org/networking-sfc/latest/) neutron extension.

The official documentation of this extension currently *only* provides command-line interface, which makes it difficult
to use this extension in a relative complex OpenStack application. This module implements wrapper classes for
SFC(Service Function Chaining) operations based on the REST API provided by the
[networking-sfc](https://docs.openstack.org/networking-sfc/latest/) extension.

Programming Language: Python 3.5.2
